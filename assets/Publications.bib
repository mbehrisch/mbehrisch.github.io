  abstract =     {News data is omnipresent in our society and functions as an important decision in
uencing
factor for a wide range of fields. Political, economical, and socio-cultural decisions
are often based on news information. A range of consequences can be derived from this
fact. Thus, it becomes more and more vital for the user to stay up-to-date and on
the other hand to develop a more critical view onto the sheer overwhelming amount
of news data from multiple news sources. The latter case is even put to the extreme
due to the Internet's advance into the field of news distribution. Particularly here the
readers are confound with contradictory, redundant and context-diverting information,
which hinders them in reaching an educated decision.
This master thesis has the overall goal to develop means and techniques for the investigative
exploration of news topic clusters, which consist of articles from multiple news
sources. Therefore, a news topic exploration pipeline, which facilitates a user's examination,
is presented. A comprehensive overview of text similarity measures, text document
clustering techniques, text summarization and related work in the area of text mining
and visualization is given. Moreover, the thesis presents NewsGuide, a fully functional
news data exploration system, which allows for an exploration of news topics on the
textual, structural and semantic layer. It incorporates new methods for guiding the user
in an effcient reading process. The developed article suggestion technique does not only
depend on the well-known textual similarity measures, but rather leverages the process
through semantics. Additionally, a topically-enhanced text summarization technique is
presented. In this context, the Bag-of-Synset textual model is presented, investigated
and enhanced with a new semantic relatedness measure. NewsGuide demonstrates its
applicability in several news exploration subelds, such as multi-document extractive
text summarization, inter-/intra- document news comparison and a novel sophisticated
analysis step: main storyline-extraction.},

The goal of this survey is to provide a comprehensive list of reordering algorithms published in different fields such as statistics,
bioinformatics, or graph theory. While several of these algorithms are described in publications and others are available in
software libraries and programs, there is little awareness of what is done across all fields. Our survey aims at describing these
reordering algorithms in a unified manner to enable a wide audience to understand their differences and subtleties. We organize
this corpus in a consistent manner, independently of the application or research field. We also provide practical guidance on
how to select appropriate algorithms depending on the structure and size of the matrix to reorder, and point to implementations
when available.},
  contribution = {Conceptualization and Contributions: The main research focus of the paper is to survey the matrix reordering algorithm landscape. The project was initiated by J.-D. Fekete. I developed the idea to enhance the focus towards a algorithm design impact. With this idea the research question changed to ``Which algorithm designs tend to produce which patterns?''. I contributed the pattern-related discussions. Implementation/Instantiation effort: B. Bach and I jointly developed the evaluation schema.
