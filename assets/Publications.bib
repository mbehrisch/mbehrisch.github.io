abstract = {With the growing prevalence of digitalisation and Artificial Intelligence (AI), energy systems are undergoing profound changes by the emergence of smart buildings. Smart buildings aim to not only intelligently control devices and appliances, but can also create active micro-grids or virtual power plants by adapting to grid conditions and communicating with other buildings. The potential to provide flexibility for the energy usage and the integration of fluctuating renewable energy make smart buildings one of the central elements to support the “energy efficiency first principle” in the usage phase of private as well as public buildings. Should smart buildings unfold their potential contribution to the future energy system, one important barrier to overcome is the adoption of these technologies by households and investors. However, it is difficult to assess the interest of the potential users on a large scale. 
To unveil where the barriers in the adoption decision lie, we apply multiple visual analysis approaches on data collected through scraping social media and online news. First, a text mining approach based on the extracted keywords is applied to discover how smart building concepts diffuse over time and spatially. On the basis of the above spatio-temporal analysis, this paper further identifies the most trending subtopics. In the end, this paper concludes with deriving recommendations on how (nudging) policies could be designed and how smart building technologies could be enhanced to increase user adaptation by a sentiment analysis.}

  abstract =     {News data is omnipresent in our society and functions as an important decision infuencing
factor for a wide range of fields. Political, economical, and socio-cultural decisions are often based on news information. A range of consequences can be derived from this fact. Thus, it becomes more and more vital for the user to stay up-to-date and on
the other hand to develop a more critical view onto the sheer overwhelming amount
of news data from multiple news sources. The latter case is even put to the extreme
due to the Internet's advance into the field of news distribution. Particularly here the
readers are confound with contradictory, redundant and context-diverting information,
which hinders them in reaching an educated decision.
This master thesis has the overall goal to develop means and techniques for the investigative
exploration of news topic clusters, which consist of articles from multiple news
sources. Therefore, a news topic exploration pipeline, which facilitates a user's examination,
is presented. A comprehensive overview of text similarity measures, text document
clustering techniques, text summarization and related work in the area of text mining
and visualization is given. Moreover, the thesis presents NewsGuide, a fully functional
news data exploration system, which allows for an exploration of news topics on the
textual, structural and semantic layer. It incorporates new methods for guiding the user
in an effcient reading process. The developed article suggestion technique does not only
depend on the well-known textual similarity measures, but rather leverages the process
through semantics. Additionally, a topically-enhanced text summarization technique is
presented. In this context, the Bag-of-Synset textual model is presented, investigated
and enhanced with a new semantic relatedness measure. NewsGuide demonstrates its
applicability in several news exploration subfields, such as multi-document extractive
text summarization, inter-/intra- document news comparison and a novel sophisticated
analysis step: main storyline-extraction.},

The goal of this survey is to provide a comprehensive list of reordering algorithms published in different fields such as statistics,
bioinformatics, or graph theory. While several of these algorithms are described in publications and others are available in
software libraries and programs, there is little awareness of what is done across all fields. Our survey aims at describing these
reordering algorithms in a unified manner to enable a wide audience to understand their differences and subtleties. We organize
this corpus in a consistent manner, independently of the application or research field. We also provide practical guidance on
how to select appropriate algorithms depending on the structure and size of the matrix to reorder, and point to implementations
when available.},

I contributed the pattern-related discussions. Implementation/Instantiation effort: B. Bach and I jointly developed the evaluation schema.

	abstract = {We present Scalable Insets, a technique for interactively exploring and navigating large numbers of annotated patterns in multiscale visual spaces such as gigapixel images, matrices, or maps. Exploration of many but sparsely-distributed patterns in multiscale visual spaces is challenging as visual representations change across zoom levels, context and navigational cues get lost upon zooming, and navigation is time consuming. Our technique visualizes annotated patterns too small to be identifiable at certain zoom levels using insets, i.e., magnified thumbnail views of the annotated pattern. Insets support users in searching, comparing, and contextualizing patterns, while reducing the amount of navigation needed. They are dynamically placed either within the viewport or along the boundary of the viewport to offer a compromise between locality and context preservation. Annotated patterns are interactively clustered by location and type. They are visually represented as an aggregated inset to provide scalable exploration within a single viewport. A controlled user study with 18 participants found improved performance in visual search (up to 45\% faster) and comparison of pattern types (up to 32 percentage points more accurate) compared to a baseline technique. A second study with 6 experts in the field of genomics showed that Scalable Insets are easy to learn and effective in a biological data exploration scenario.},
